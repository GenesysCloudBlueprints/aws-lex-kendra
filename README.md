#  Deployment Guide for the Lex-Kendra Chatbot on Genesys Cloud
This Genesys Blueprint provides instructions for deploying the Lex-Kendra chatbot on Genesys Cloud. The Lex-Kendra chatbot is part of the AWS Contact Center Intelligence (CCI) accelerator. This integrated solution enhances the capabilities of Genesys Cloud with a conversational AI capability from AWS. Both Genesys Cloud and the Lex-Kendra solution components reside natively on AWS Cloud.

Genesys Cloud uses the Genesys Cloud Lex integration to provide customers with a standard Amazon Lex chatbot. The Lex-Kendra chatbot solution combines this basic Lex chatbot with Amazon Kendra to create a Lex-Kendra self-service chatbot. This combination enables an Amazon Lex flow to invoke an AWS Lambda function to call Amazon Kendra after a customer initiates a chat and enters a triggering question. Amazon Kendra uses natural language processing and machine learning abilities to process the customer's question and search an informational database stored in Amazon S3. Amazon Kendra and AWS Lambda then route the discovered answer back into the customer chat. All of this occurs without live agent assistance.

## Create a Genesys web chat widget and test the Lex-Kendra solution
You need to complete the following procedures in Genesys Cloud and the Genesys Cloud Developer Center Web Chat developer tool:
### Create a Genesys web chat widget
1. From the Genesys Cloud admin menu, create a Genesys Widget Version 2 in the normal manner. For more information, see the *Version 2* section in [Create a widget for web chat](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=195772 "Opens the widget for web chat article").

**Note:** In the Create a widget for web chat procedure, in the **Route to Flow** menu, choose the flow you created in the earlier procedure.

2. After you save the widget, the saved page displays a Deployment Key string. Copy the Deployment Key string for later use.
3. From your browser, go to the Genesys Cloud Developer Center and open the Web Chat developer tool. For more information, see [Web Chat developer tool quick start](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/gettingstarted/developer-tools-web-chats.html "Opens the Web Chat developer tool quick start article").

**Note:** The Web Chat developer tool populates with menu options for the widget and queue you created earlier through shared authentication between Genesys Cloud and the developer tools. If the menu is not populated, use the Deployment Key string you copied earlier.

4. From the Web Chat developer tool, under the **Deployment** menu, select the chat widget you created.
5. Under the **Queue** menu, select the appropriate queue.
![Web Chat developer tool](/images/bp_kendra_wc1.png)

You have have completed the configuration for the Lex-Kendra chatbot solution. Proceed to the next section to test the solution before you deploy it to your website.
### Test the Lex-Kendra solution
1. Click **Start Chat** to test your Lex-Kendra chatbot solution.
2. Type in test questions to trigger a specific bot response.

To help formulate test questions to elicit a specific response, you can use the AWS console to examine the Kendra_Search_Intent and also the .CSV file you uploaded to the S3 bucket. See the sample questions below for examples of a standard Lex response and a response from a Kendra interaction.

**Sample Question 1**

The question "What is the incubation period for the virus?" elicits a standard Lex intent. You can confirm this is a standard Lex intent by observing the response begins with the term "Amazon Lex". The bot icon in the text stream also confirms the response is from the bot.

![Sample Question 1](/images/bp_kendra_TQ1.png)

**Sample Question 2**

The question "What precautions can I take?" does not elicit a standard Lex intent, as there is no Lex intent preconfigured for that question. This question triggers a Kendra search and the response comes from a search of the document you uploaded into your S3 bucket. You can confirm this is a Lex-Kendra response by observing the response begins with the term "On searching the Enterprise repository".
![Sample Question 2](/images/bp_kendra_TQ2.png)
